This MATLAB package provides an implementation of the scattering transform as
defined in [1] with additions related to audio data [3,4] and image data [2].

The main function is 'scatt', which computes the scattering transform of a
signal with several optional parameters. It takes both 1D and 2D signals.

For audio signals, there is also 'cl_scatt', which computes the cosine log-
scattering coefficients for a given signal, which is a representation 
tailored to audio data. Notably, it computes the log of the scattering 
coefficients and transforms these using a DCT to reduce the dimensionality.
This is done with the functions 'transform_scatt' and 'dctmask'. For a 
demonstration of functionality on audio signals, see demo/demo_audio.m .

Experimental functionality is included for image data.

The directory structure is as follows:

- audio: Functions specific to handing audio scattering with
  cosine-log scattering coefficients.
- demo: Demo scripts to show the functionality of the toolbox.
- scattering/1d: The filter-generating functions for 1D data. This includes a
  mel-like filter bank in audio_filter_bank as well as ordinary Cauchy and 
  spline filter banks.
- scattering/2d: Experimental filter-generating functions for 2D data.
- scattering/common: Main scattering functionality for 1D and 2D data:
  computing scattering coefficients as well as applying orthogonal operators
  to scattering vectors.
- scattering/display: Functions for visualing scattering transforms.
