%DCT_MASK Computes a mask on the DCT representation of a scattering vector
%   mask = dct_mask(meta,options) takes as input the metainformation from 
%   transform_scatt and a set of mask paremeters in options. It uses these to
%   create a mask of the DCT coefficients that selects the low-frequency (in
%   the sense of DCT frequency) components.
%
%   The mask parameters are found in options.dct_mask . These consist of four
%   values: a1, a2, b1 and b2. The first two, a1 and a2 specify a rectangle
%   in the DCT coefficient space, while b1 and b2 specify another rectangle.
%   The mask is then the union of these two rectangles. If we have J+P filters
%   in our wavelet decomposition, the first rectangle contains the
%   coefficients with k_1 (the DCT transform of j_1) less than a1*(J+P) and k_2
%   less than a2. In the same way, the second rectangle contains the
%   coefficients such that k_1 < b1*(J+P) and k_2 < b2. Default values are
%   a1 = 0.4, a2 = 3, b1 = 0.05, b2 = 6.
