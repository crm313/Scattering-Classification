%SCATT Scattering transform wrapper
%   [out,meta] = scatt(in,options) calculates the scattering coefficients of
%   in using parameters in options and performs the necessary pre- and 
%   post-processing.
%
%   For scattering options, see core_scatt for details.
%
%   The output is presented in the format specified by options.format. 
%   Possible formats are the following [default 'split']:
%       - 'raw' simply outputs the result of core_scatt without modifying it.
%         The variable meta is unused in this format.
%       - 'split' outputs the result of core_scatt in the form of a table. In
%         the case of 1D input, the output is two-dimensional with the first
%         dimension corresponding to the signal domain and the second 
%         dimension corresponding to the path space. For 2D input, the 
%         structure is the same except for the output being three-dimensional 
%         and the first two dimensions corresponding to the signal domain. 
%         The meta structure contains three variables parametrized by the 
%         path space: 'order' which specifies the order of the path from 0 to
%         M, 'scale' which encodes the successive scales in the path, and 
%         'orientation' which encodes the successive orientations. Scale and
%         resolution are specified in base M, where M is the maximal 
%         scale/resolution and the most significant digit corresponding so 
%         the first path component.
%       - 'array' outputs the same table as the format 'split', but collapsed
%         into a column vector.
