%DISPLAY_1D_SCATTER_SLICE Shows the scattering vector of a time-slice
%   display_1d_scatter_slice(in,meta,ts,options) displays the first- and
%   second-order coefficients of a scattering vector in with metadata meta for
%   a given point in time ts (or the average of multiple time points). This is
%   done by displaying the first order frequency vertically for the first and
%   second order and the second order frequency horizontally.
%
%   The following options can be specified
%      options.display_with_log - When set to 1, instead of displaying the 
%         value of the coefficents, its logarithm is displayed. [default 1]
